## Exports

### Server Exports

```lua
-- Jail a player
exports['ejj_prison']:JailPlayer(source, targetId, duration, prisonId)
-- Returns: boolean (success)
-- Note: source is optional. If not provided, it will be treated as a system action

-- Unjail a player
exports['ejj_prison']:UnjailPlayer(source, targetId)
-- Returns: boolean (success)
-- Note: source is optional. If not provided, it will be treated as a system action

-- Check a player's jail time
exports['ejj_prison']:CheckJailTime(source, targetId)
-- Returns: number (jail time in minutes) or false
-- Note: source is optional. If not provided, it will be treated as a system action

-- Add time to a player's sentence
exports['ejj_prison']:AddJailTime(source, targetId, additionalTime)
-- Returns: boolean (success)

exports['ejj_prison']:RemoveJailTime(source, targetId, removeTime)

```lua
-- Jail a player (client-side)
exports['ejj_prison']:JailPlayer(playerId, jailTime)
-- Returns: boolean (success)

-- Unjail a player (client-side)
exports['ejj_prison']:UnjailPlayer(playerId)
-- Returns: boolean (success)
```

## Configuration

Check out `config.lua` to customize:
- Prison locations
- Jail times
- Required permissions
- Allowed jobs
- Permission bypass for NPCs/peds
- And more!

### Permission Bypass

You can enable permission bypass for NPCs/peds by setting `Config.BypassPermissions = true` in your `config.lua`. This allows:
- NPCs to jail players without permission checks
- System scripts to use jail functions without a source
- Custom integrations to work without permission requirements

Example usage with NPCs:
```lua
-- From an NPC script
exports['ejj_prison']:JailPlayer(nil, targetId, duration, prisonId)

-- From console
exports['ejj_prison']:JailPlayer(0, targetId, duration, prisonId)

-- From a player script
exports['ejj_prison']:JailPlayer(source, targetId, duration, prisonId)
```
